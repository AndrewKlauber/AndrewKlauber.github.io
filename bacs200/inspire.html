        Superhero is a word almost synonymous with the name Ayrton Senna. Ayrton inspired people from all walks of life, backgrounds, and cultures.
      Ayrton was a hero of Brazil and a hero of racing. Over the course of his racing career, Ayrton donated more than $400 million dollars to charities 
      and impoverished people in Brazil and around the world, but Ayrton never mentioned this publicly.

        Ayrton was a brutal and fierce competitor on the racetrack, but in his heart he was a gentle and kind man. He never quit.

        Some of the highlights of Ayrtonâ€™s career that exemplifies his character include his home race performance in 1991, when Ayrton finished the 
      final 7 laps of the race using only the 6th gear of his car, as the gearbox had failed and he was unable to shift. His compassion for his fellow 
      man showed bright in the Belgian Grand Prix of 1992, when a driver Eric Comas crashed his car on track, and Ayrton pulled to the side of the 
      road and dragged the unconscious Eric Comas from his wrecked car, on the brink of bursting into flames.
