        <p class="bg-light p-2 rounded">
           The current stock exchange is heavily influenced by emotional trading. One of the fastest growing fields in finance is the study of behavioral finance, the field tries to make sense of  the way stocks are traded based on emotional speculation, reactions, and fear and acceptance of uncertainty. Most of the people who trade on the market are casual investors, and almost all of these casual investors trade solely on intuition and their gut feeling. This means large changes in a market can be due to speculation and fear, rather than data and metrics. This is emphasized by social media and the growing influence it has on investors. Many people will buy or sell securities because their friends or an influencer they follow told them to, thinking these people know best for their money. It is very hard to structure a market for the future of our world when so much trading is done on emotion.

        <p class="bg-light px-2 pt-2 rounded-top mb-0">
           The primary focus of financial managers is to create value for their shareholders. The question is should that value be created in the near future, or the long term future? The conflict between the desire for as much short term gains, and the push for long term wealth is what keeps any economy from long term growth. Especially now, in a pivotal moment in history, where fossil fuels are on their way out, building an economy for centuries into the future should be our primary economic goal. We must differentiate between industries that will last, and industries that are on their way out.

        <p class="bg-light p-2 rounded">
            Because of political polarization and extremism in recent times, our markets have taken a blow. Political disruption and extremely polarized views create volatility in the market, meaning long term growth and future economic strength is hard to build. Politics will always influence the stock market, but political uncertainty does not have to like it does today.

                The best way forward for the stock exchange, to create the most long term wealth for shareholders and provide financial stability to the entire world, is founded in identifying the direction the world needs to go. Industries that provide long term energy solutions will not give the best return on investment for now, but will provide the most wealth in the future. Political, economic, and social structures must change to provide future wealth and stability, not short term profits at the cost of future potential.
